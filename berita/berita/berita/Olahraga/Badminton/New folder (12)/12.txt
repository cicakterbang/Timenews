China's Domination on Women's Badminton Eroded?
All England 2016 has ended on Sunday, March 13. The championship produced  several new champions. Another notable outcome, the Chinese domination on the women's badminton is broken by Japan.
 
At the women's single, the champion's name is no longer a Chinese badminton player. The current limelight is on the Japanese player, Nozomi Okuhara, who became the winner of the All England Women's Singles this year.
 
In her young age of 21, Okuhara was capable of overthrowing all predictions. She played perfectly well since the early stages, as she strolled to the finals after winning over the Thailand's Nitcahon Jindapol; Indonesia's Lindaweni Fanetri; and China's Wang Yihan.
 
Finally, Okuhara was able to seal her victory by beating Spain's Carolina Marin and China's Wang Shixian. The accomplishment has made Japan to shine at the Women's Singles.
 
The last time Japan became the victor of Women's Single was 38 years ago, or precisely in 1978. At the time, Hiroe Yuki emerged victorious. But afterwards, Japan has to be patient in only observing Chinese domination in the arena.
 
A surprising result also occurred on the Women's Doubles, where Japanese team, Misaki Matsumoto/Ayaka Takahashi also emerged as victors. They were able to surpass expectations by beating Chinese Doubles, Luo Ying/Luo Yu, with a straight set of 21-12 and 21-9.
 
The achievement has become a historical moment at the All England 2016, as the Chinese women athletes had reigned the doubles and singles for the past 10 years.
 
The last time China was without a title in the two arenas was in mid 1995. At the time, Swedish athlete - who was born in China - Lim Xiaoqing became champion, with the South Korean Double Gil Young-ah/Jang Hye-ock successfully secured their top position.
